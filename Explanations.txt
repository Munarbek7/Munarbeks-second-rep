Project Description
This is a console-based calculator written in Java. It supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) and additional functions (power, sqrt, abs, round). The program follows operator precedence, handles invalid inputs, and includes a history feature.

Features

Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %
Functions: power(base, exponent), sqrt(number), abs(number), round(number)
Handles operator precedence
Graceful error handling (e.g., division by zero, invalid expressions)
History feature to recall past calculations
No external libraries required (pure Java)
Design & Implementation
Algorithm:

Uses the Shunting-yard algorithm to evaluate expressions correctly.
Postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) is used for computation.
Data Structures Used:

Stack (for operators in infix-to-postfix conversion).
Queue (for postfix evaluation).
Error Handling:

Catches invalid expressions.
Handles division by zero.
Detects mismatched parentheses.
How to Use

Run the program in a Java-supported IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Enter an expression, for example:
5 + 3 * (2 + 8)
The program evaluates the result and asks if you want to continue.
Type "history" to see past calculations.
Type "exit" to quit.
How to Run (Using Terminal)
Compile the Java file:
javac Calculator.java
Run the program:
java Calculator

Example Inputs & Outputs

Example 1:
Input:
5 + 3 * (2 + 8)
Output:
Result: 35

Example 2:
Input:
power(2, 3) - round(4.6) / 2
Output:
Result: 6

Example 3:
Input:
history
Output:
Calculation History:
5 + 3 * (2 + 8) = 35
power(2, 3) - round(4.6) / 2 = 6
